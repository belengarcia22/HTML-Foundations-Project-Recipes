    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="section"></div>
    <p>Toum is a Middle Eastern garlic sauce that is made by emulsifying garlic, lemon juice, oil & salt.</p>
<div>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="section"></div>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large garlic bulbs (120g - 140g cloves)</li>
        <li>80ml lemon juice</li>
        <li>400 ml olive oil</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<div class="section"></div>
<ol>
    <li>Peel the garlic cloves, cut each clove in half and remove the germ.</li>
    <li>Place the garlic halves into the bowl of a food processor along with 2 tsp of salt and process it into a smooth purée.
         In the beginning, the garlic will stick to the sides of the bowl, so scrape it down a few times until it begins to break down into a paste. 
         Then add 2 tbsp of the lemon juice (it acts as a stabiliser) and continue blending until smooth, scraping down again if necessary.</li>
    <li>With the machine running on low, slowly drizzle in about 1 - 2 tbsp of oil until the garlic and oil begin to emulsify, scraping down the sides again.
         Then continue slowly pouring in the oil until you used around 100 ml.
          Slowly drizzle in 1 tbsp of lemon juice, and continue this way, alternating between 100 ml of oil and 1 tbsp of lemon juice until you’ve used up all of the liquids and the toum is light and fluffy. 
          This process can take around 15 minutes, so make sure to take your time when pouring so that the emulsion doesn’t break. Transfer the toum to a bowl and refrigerate until needed. 
          The harsh flavour of the garlic will mellow out a little bit over time, so this is best enjoyed the next day</li>
          <li>What to do if your emulsion breaks? The easiest way to fix a broken emulsion is to transfer the ingredients to a tall jug and add 4 tbsp of aquafaba (the liquid in a tin of chickpeas).
             Now use an immersion blender to blend it all together. Within a few seconds, it should emulsify into a smooth sauce.</li>
             <li>Storage: Keep refrigerated for 4 weeks.</li>
